\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have constructed our models based on the biological features of EVD, social features of human society and several reasonable assumptions. Our models consist of two parts: one is considering the the spread of disease within a single city and serves as the base of the other; the other takes the people flow among the cities into account, the application of which gives an optimized plan regarding how should we allocate the resources of medication such as vaccine.

Both of the models are applied to specific cases separately, and the results of computation which are carefully studied justified our model. Through our analysis of the model, we explored and explained the complex relationship among numerous variables and parameters.

The effectiveness of medical treatment ( including segregation, vaccination and pharmacotherapy ) is verified by our model and the strategy to allocate vaccine and drug is revealed by our investigation.
